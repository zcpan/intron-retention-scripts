# intron-retention-scripts

The present folder contains scripts from the manuscript entitled 'Tracking pre-mRNA maturation across subcellular compartments identifies developmental gene regulation through intron retention and nuclear anchoring'

These scripts are meant to provide additional transparency on the code underlying the results from the manuscript. 

Scripts are broken down by the order of analysis. 

Note however that due to the computational nature of the analysis performed, the scripts may require high memory to be run, or parallelization through a cluster. In addition, some parts of the analysis have been rewritten to improve clarity of the pipeline. In doing so, some bugs may have escaped our vigilance. Thus the code is provided without warranty. If you try to rerun these analyses and encounter any problem, please report it to the author (zcpan1016@gmail.com).
